                <h2>our history</h2>
                <p>We are a company that has been working since 2000. We founded Travelers because we are a family that loves the mountains and all the activities that can be done. In addition, we think about the satisfaction that they can generate to one and how fun it can be. So what better idea than to create a recreational space and enable activities with work teams and professionals. We got to work and began to design each activity with its specific equipment, we built a dock and bought 15 kayaks. We bought bicycles with equipment to ride and also snowboards. We hire a team of professionals so that they can carry out the activities and that clients feel safe in what they do. Although at the beginning we were the guides since we did not have enough capital to hire a team. So now you know how we started on this adventure!</p>
